# Claw Design Process
## Objectives
The claw is a critical component of our FTC robot, as it directly enables us to score points. Since its sole function is to pick up and transport samples, we were able to design it with a singular focus on efficiency and precision. Every aspect of the claw was carefully optimized to ensure it performs this task flawlessly.

## Grabber Shape
Several initial concepts were considered for the grabber’s shape, including:
- Triangular prism
- 3D frustums
- Cone
After evaluating these options, the 3D frustums were chosen as the optimal design. This choice allows the sample to snap into position while enabling gripping in two orientations. The cone permitted too much free rotation, reducing control, while the triangular prism could only pick up objects in a single orientation.

## Opening and Closing Mechanism
The following mechanisms were explored for the claw’s opening and closing functionality:
- Rack and pinion system
- Adjacent gears
The final design incorporates two adjacent gears, as this configuration is the simplest to implement while remaining compact and minimally intrusive to other robot components.

# First 3D Design
We used [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) to make a 3D model of the initial 2D design, enabling us to visualise how the claw would fit into the rest of the robot.

The holes in the circles are long to allow minute adjustments to ensure the gear teeth mesh properly and don’t slip.
